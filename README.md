# Tank-Production-Process
The project aims to model and analyze the operation of complex systems to support management decision-making and optimize production processes by improving the revenue, profit, efficiency, reducing manufacturing costs, backlogs, and lead time.

The objective of this project is to model and analyze the operation of complex systems to support management decision-making, and optimize production processes by improving the company's revenue, profit, efficiency, and reducing manufacturing costs, backlogs, and lead time. See the following detail:
1. Identify Bottleneck: Analyse areas in the production line where there is delay
2. Strategy Scenario Analysis: Proposed new scenario and analyse the impact of proposed changes
3. Profit Maximization: Allocate resources to avoid overloading or underutilized machinery and workers.
4. Efficiency: Reduce Manufacturing Cost, Backlogs, and Lead Time

The model time unit based on daily as per the real one from the case with the real time scale 1 as the execution mode by the stop at specified time 90 calendar days. The following is the result (for the initial condition without any strategy scenario intervention) after we compared by the face validation (asking people knowledgeable / experienced system under study) at the workshop. With the result that the simulation model generated such as:
1. Revenue, manufacturing costs, backlog costs, and profit almost exactly almost like in the companyʼs real situation at the moment.
2. Total order, backlogs, and outputs almost exactly almost like in the companyʼs real situation at the moment.
3. Flow time, and lead time almost exactly almost like in the companyʼs real situation at the moment.
